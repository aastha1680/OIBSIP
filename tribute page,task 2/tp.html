          <h2>THE QUEEN OF SOUL</h2>
          <p>
            Lata Mangeshkar, supreme artiste of Indian playback singing, her voice the crucible of our emotions and sentiments, whose talent drew from both our sacred and secular traditions, passed away at 92 on February 6, 2022.it is impossible to write about Lata Mangeshkar with clinical objectivity if you love Indian music.

            Some of us who grew up before the 2000s have a Lata song for every occasion, every mood and every twist of fate. When you need a pick-me-up from the dull funk of pandemic oppression, search Aaj Phir Jeene ki Tamanna Hai (Guide, 1965) on your Spotify. Joy swells in-between its syllables.
            
            When I think of my mother, I listen to Luka Chuppi (Rang De Basanti, 2006); the tears flow. Her voice had lost its limpidness by the 1990s, but with A.R. Rehmanâ€™s orchestration, it is a piercingly emotional song about mother-child longing.
            
            I remember my father by the Bengali song O Mor Moyna Go (1975, not from a film) because in his flat baritone he would sometimes sing it to cheer me up.
